in the C and Makefile - so far two external libs added to the dieharder-2.24.7/dieharder/Makefile, and one #include plus new rng type allocation done on the add_ui_rngs.c file.

make now takes a parameter my_build=[debug|release|profile|whatever]

This tells dieharder what version of our libraries to link against.
If it is omitted 'debug' is assumed.

If your config is the same as mine you can just do a top level (RandomLibrary) make and all will be dandy, otherwise build dieharder separatly using it's autogen stuff and then edit your new dieharder-2.24.7/dieharder/Makefile as I have done.  After that, all will be dandy going forward (assuming you never re-autogen!).

Directory structure of dieharder is maintained - so all current edits need to be applied to:
dieharder-2.24.7/dieharder/<filename>

Enjoy!

Phil.
